# CNN-Model
- Convolutional neural networks are one of the most popular models.
- This model uses a variation of multilayer perceptrons and contains one or more convolutional layers that can be either entirely connected or pooled. 
- These convolutional layers create feature maps that record a region of image which is ultimately broken into rectangles and sent out for nonlinear processing.

##### Advantages:
- Very High accuracy in image recognition problems.
- Automatically detects the important features without any human supervision.
- Weight sharing.
##### Disadvantages:
- CNN do not encode the position and orientation of object.
- Lack of ability to be spatially invariant to the input data.
- Lots of training data is required.
